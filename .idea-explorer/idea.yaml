  title: Do Multi-Turn Conversations Regress to the Prior?
  domain: nlp
  hypothesis: 'In long multi-turn conversations, large language models tend to regress
    to their base level prior, with alignment training effects diminishing after the
    initial turns.

    '
  background:
    description: 'I have a theory: I hypothesize that in long multi-turn conversations,
      LLMs regress to their base level prior more than anything else. Of course, there''s
      a significant amount of noise explaining the total degeneration after long multi-turn
      conversations, but I think a significant amount of what''s happening is that
      the alignment training only works for the first few terms, which are the Space
      the model has most well-tread when undergoing alignment.'
